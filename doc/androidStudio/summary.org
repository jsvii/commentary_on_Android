## 设置

### 取消auto synchronize

This is a little late, but for anyone else looking:

In "Settings" -> "Appearance & Behavior" -> "System Settings"

Uncheck "Synchronize files on frame or editor tab activation"

You'll have to remember to hit the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button whenever you make changes to Gradle. (To the left of AVD Manager)
