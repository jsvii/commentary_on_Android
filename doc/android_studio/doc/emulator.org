* Hyper V 上支持Android emulator

The solution (if you do not want to disable Hyper-V) is to use Microsoft’s Android emulator, which is a free download here.

In order to use this with Android Studio, you need to run the emulator first. Then, in Android Studio, go to Run > Edit Configurations... and select Show Device Chooser Dialog under Deployment Target Options.

Run your project, and select the VS Emulator, ignoring the invitation to “Turn off Hyper-V”.
